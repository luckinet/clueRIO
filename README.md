## Overview

The
[CLUMondo](https://www.environmentalgeography.nl/site/data-models/models/clumondo-model/)
model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land use and land cover change
model. clueRIO manages input/output for setting up the file-structure
required for successfully configuring and running a CLUE model. This
acts as an interface that enables users to build and document scenarios
based on such models quickly and in a script-based fashion.

The most up-to-date version is typically a command line version. This
R-package has the aim to simplify specifying all files needed to
successfully run that version. Please make sure to reference not only
this R-package, but also the references on the website and in particular

intensification: simulating land system change with a global-scale land
change model. Global Change Biology 19, 3648â€“3667*.

## Installation

Install the official version from CRAN:

``` r
# install.packages("clueRIO")
```

Install the latest development version from github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("luckinet/clueRIO")
```

## Examples

``` r
library(clueRIO); library(tibble)

data <- system.file("test_data", package = "clueRIO", mustWork = TRUE)

# our example model will be called '2 land systems (ls2), 1 demand (d1)'.
model <- "ls2d1"

# open a new scene for the model
minimal <- clue_scene(
  root = paste0(tempdir(), "/", model), 
  name = model, 
  period = c(2000, 2024),
  regions = paste0(data, "/test_region.gpkg"),
  description = "this is a minimal showcase where forest is converted to cropland to produce crops.")

# first, specify the gridded items ...
# ... initial land systems
minimal <- minimal |> 
  clue_gridded(file = paste0(data, "/ls2.tif"),
               type = "initial")

# ... then suitability drivers
minimal <- minimal |> 
  clue_gridded(file = paste0(data, "/suitability1.tif"), 
               type = "driver", name = "cropland_suit") |> 
  clue_gridded(file = paste0(data, "/suitability2_0.tif"),
               type = "driver", name = "forest_suit")

# setup land types
minimal <- minimal |> 
  # forest shall be convertable to cropland
  clue_landtype(name = "forest", resistance = 0.5,
                suitability = tibble(driver = c("const", "forest_suit"),
                                     beta = c(1, 1)),
                conversion = tibble(to = "cropland", 
                                    label = "intensification")) |> 
  # cropland shall produce crops
  clue_landtype(name = "cropland", resistance = 0.5,
                suitability = tibble(driver = c("const", "cropland_suit"),
                                     beta = c(1, 1)),
                production = tibble(goods = "crops", 
                                    amount = 1, priority = 1))


# setup goods and services
minimal <- minimal |> 
  clue_goods(name = "crops", 
             demand = tibble(year = c(2000:2024), 
                             region = "ravenholm", 
                             amount = seq(from = 4760, to = 5000, length.out = 25)))

# possibly adapt options
# clue_options(...)

# initiate the model
clue_initiate(scene = minimal)

# and finally run the model
clue_run(scene = minimal)

# possibly backup the model outputs
# clue_backup(scene = minimal)
```
