Description: The CLUMondo model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land use and 
    land cover change model. clueRIO manages input/output for setting up the
    file-structure required for successfully configuring and running a CLUE
    model. This acts as an interface that enables users to build and document
    scenarios based on such models quickly and in a script-based fashion.
