The [CLUMondo](https://www.environmentalgeography.nl/site/data-models/models/clumondo-model/) model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land use and land cover change model. clueRIO manages input/output for setting up the file-structure required for successfully configuring and running a CLUE model. This acts as an interface that enables users to build and document scenarios based on such models quickly and in a script-based fashion.

The most up-to-date version is typically a command line version. This R-package has the aim to simplify specifying all files needed to successfully run that version. Please make sure to reference not only this R-package, but also the references on the website and in particular *Van Asselen, S., Verburg, P.H., 2013. Land cover change or land-use intensification: simulating land system change with a global-scale land change model. Global Change Biology 19, 3648â€“3667*.
